It all started on one fine morning (well, that's a relative perspective) when the two better halves turned a seemingly istupid conversation towards a really knowledgeable flow of emotional argumentative discussion (I guess, all my married friends can relate to the **reality**).

After sometime, there surface a pictorial representation of "<u>out of syllabus</u>".

Now the better half might feel a little disrespect upon arriving onto such representation of a purely academic phrase (an oversimplified analogy). In the hope of balancing the tide, the (other) better half explains, that it represents everyone, with the exact finishing line "this is as true for you, me & everyone else with free will..."

Here it comes to the deterministic & nondeterministic probability. Now the fun fact is, the origin for both of them are same (in short, the same set of elements can produce both predictable & unpredictable future). Although for most of the cases, we know (i.e. calculate) for certain, what will be the state of something at a certain time in future (like, where the earth will be, at which angle at its axis & how far from sun at a particular time after now), while on the same hand, it may/or may not be predicted whether a person, entering a cafe will order latte or black-coffee just after a few seconds (but, a dog will definitely waive its tail if you give a piece of meat). What differs a dog from a human in such cases**???** Here comes the hypothetical phenomenon called **"free will"**, which a person has, but a dog can't have. This addition of free will causes a ripple in the face of reality (or in this case, the _quantum realm_, where **"reality"** starts, as some have suggested).

Why comparing between earth & a person, you may ask**???**

Well, in **reality**, they both are made up of same basic elements, and somehow, they ***ARE*** supposed to be.
