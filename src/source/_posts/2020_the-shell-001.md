"Are you going to accept the challenge or not?" - with a gentle smile you asked me.

"Can I have another one of this?" - I feel thirsty & feel the need to watch the glass in front of me to be full rather than being empty.

"Of course mate, nothing is forbidden, nor out of stock here." - you signal the counter and in the next moment, someone fill it with water.

"Well, until you taste it, how can you be sure it is what it is seemed to be?" - as if you can read my mind.

"It is just an observation and a logical deduction after all of our past encounters." - now it doesn't feel right.

"Woooooh, do not be so tensed now. I am going to answer all your question and you will surely feel good after that."

*!"What's going on here? Where am I?"!* & that's it... I wake up in my bed... Yupp, I'm thirsty, too...
